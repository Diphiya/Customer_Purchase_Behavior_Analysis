# 📊 Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project showcases an **end-to-end data analytics workflow** aligned with real-world **data analyst responsibilities**. It focuses on transforming raw data into **actionable business insights** using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

The project demonstrates strong skills in:
- Data exploration and cleaning  
- Writing analytical SQL queries  
- Building dashboards for stakeholder decision-making  

---

## Dataset

## Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Loading**
   - Imported raw data into Python
   - Reviewed schema, data types, and structure

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summary statistics and distributions
   - Trend analysis and pattern identification
   - Detection of missing values and anomalies

3. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Handled missing and inconsistent data
   - Standardized formats (dates, categories, numerical fields)
   - Prepared clean tables for SQL analysis and reporting

4. **SQL-Based Analysis**
   - Loaded cleaned data into relational databases
   - Performed analytical queries including:
     - KPI calculations
     - Grouped and time-based analysis
     - Category and segment comparisons
     - Joins across multiple tables

5. **Data Visualization & Reporting**
   - Built an interactive Power BI dashboard
   - Designed visuals to support business decision-making

---

## Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard highlights:
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Trends and changes over time
- Category-wise and segment-wise analysis
- Interactive filters and slicers for exploration

---

## Key Insights & Results
- Identified important trends and performance patterns
- Highlighted high- and low-performing segments
- Provided data-driven insights to support operational and strategic decisions
